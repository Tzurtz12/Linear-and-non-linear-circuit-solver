# Electronic Circuit Simulation

Welcome to the Electronic Circuit Simulation repository! This project allows you to simulate both linear and non-linear electronic circuits using Python's NumPy library.

## Features

- **Linear Circuit Simulation**: Analyze circuits composed of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
- **Non-Linear Circuit Simulation**: Simulate circuits with non-linear components like diodes and transistors.
- **Customizable Components**: Easily define and modify components and circuit parameters.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots of circuit behaviors such as voltage and current over time using Matplotlib.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
